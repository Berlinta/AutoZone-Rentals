# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# cars.create(name: "Ferrari" , location: "California")
# cars.create(name: "Lamborghini" , location: "New York")
# cars.create(name: "Porsche" , location: "Miami")
# cars.create(name: "McLaren" , location: "Dallas")
# cars.create(name: "Bugatti", location: "Las Vegas")
